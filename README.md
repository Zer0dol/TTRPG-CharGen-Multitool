# TTRPG-CharGen-Multitool
This is my attempt to create some sort of multitool for character generation for different TTRPG systems. I know that there's already a plenty of things like that in the internet but I decided to make one myself since it supposed to be my university programming project which I've never started working on cuz my teacher gave me a credit anyways. Since I'm a beginner programmer, most of people will probably see this project's code as some sort of gore so... uh... You've been warned.
This is mostly going to be Python but I think that I could switch to another language and redo everything from scratch at some point.
